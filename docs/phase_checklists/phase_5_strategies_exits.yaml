phase: Phase 5 — Strategy Profiles + Exit Profiles

checklist:
  - id: P5-01
    task: strategies.yaml defines risk_pct and exit_profile per strategy
    status: DONE
    evidence: config/strategies.yaml includes risk_pct + exit_profile mappings

  - id: P5-02
    task: Exit profiles file exists and is used
    status: DONE
    evidence: config/exit_profiles.yaml exists and tp_sl_manager loads profiles

  - id: P5-03
    task: TP/SL manager honors exit profiles (standard_10/standard_5/custom_5)
    status: DONE
    evidence: tp_sl_manager.py reads exit_profile and places correct ladder behavior

  - id: P5-04
    task: Deterministic profile tester exists
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: app/tools/tp_sl_profile_tester.py validates TP count, spacing, sizing sums for synthetic positions

  - id: P5-05
    task: Custom_5 spec defined (contract, not just a label)
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: docs/exit_profiles.md or config notes define how custom_5 differs from standard_5

  - id: P5-06
    task: exit_profile is logged into AI dataset
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: setup_memory includes exit_profile field so AI can compare performance across profiles
