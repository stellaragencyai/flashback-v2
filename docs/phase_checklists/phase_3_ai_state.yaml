phase: Phase 3 — AI State Engine

checklist:
  - id: P3-01
    task: Feature snapshots captured at trade open
    status: DONE
    evidence: app/ai/feature_logger.py exists and writes feature snapshots in a consistent format

  - id: P3-02
    task: Feature store builder exists
    status: DONE
    evidence: app/tools/feature_store_builder.py builds state/feature_store.jsonl (or equivalent canonical output)

  - id: P3-03
    task: AI state inspection tool exists
    status: DONE
    evidence: app/tools/ai_state_inspector.py summarizes counts, symbols, strategies

  - id: P3-04
    task: AI state health enforcement exists (min samples, skew warnings)
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: app/tools/ai_state_health.py outputs RED/YELLOW/GREEN with thresholds

  - id: P3-05
    task: Dataset schema validation is enforced
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: health tool validates required keys/schema version and fails loudly

  - id: P3-06
    task: Daily maintenance command exists (build → health)
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: scripts/ai_phase3_daily.ps1 runs builder then health and prints summary

  - id: P3-07
    task: Clear empty-dataset behavior
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: builder/health prints “No trades yet; OK” instead of failing or silently doing nothing

  - id: P3-08
    task: AI state bus/store access layer exists
    status: DONE
    evidence: app/core/ai_state_bus.py and ai_store.py exist and are used
