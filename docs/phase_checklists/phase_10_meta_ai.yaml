phase: Phase 10 — Multi-AI Non-Human Ecosystem

checklist:
  - id: P10-01
    task: Governance spec exists (what AI can change, what requires approval)
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: docs/phase_10_governance.md defines permissions + rollback rules

  - id: P10-02
    task: Meta-AI package exists with clear agent boundaries
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: app/meta_ai/ contains separate agents (policy, strategy, risk, ops, allocator)

  - id: P10-03
    task: Experiment registry exists (A/B, cohorts, promotion rules)
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: config/experiments.yaml + tooling to record experiment ids in datasets/logs

  - id: P10-04
    task: Automatic rollback mechanism exists for bad promotions
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: model/strategy promotions can be reverted automatically on performance deterioration

  - id: P10-05
    task: Capital allocator agent exists (subaccount allocation policy)
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: allocator reads performance + risk budgets and recommends/executes allocations safely

  - id: P10-06
    task: Ops self-healing exists (restart dead workers, detect drift, safe stop)
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: meta ops agent monitors health signals and enforces safe mode without human babysitting
