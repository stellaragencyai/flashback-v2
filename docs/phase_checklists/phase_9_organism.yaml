phase: Phase 9 — Fully Automated, Self-Learning Trading Organism

checklist:
  - id: P9-01
    task: Builders exist (feature store + setup memory)
    status: DONE
    evidence: feature_store_builder + setup_memory_builder exist and produce canonical outputs

  - id: P9-02
    task: Model training script exists
    status: DONE
    evidence: app/ai/train_models.py exists and outputs model artifacts

  - id: P9-03
    task: Full cycle orchestrator exists (build → train → evaluate → export)
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: app/ai/ai_full_cycle.py runs end-to-end reliably

  - id: P9-04
    task: Model registry + versioning exists
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: models/ contains versioned model + meta json per version

  - id: P9-05
    task: Safe promotion logic exists
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: new model promoted only if metrics >= previous; otherwise rejected

  - id: P9-06
    task: Deployment contract exists (executor loads chosen model version)
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: setup_policy selects model version; executor loads that version deterministically

  - id: P9-07
    task: Training schedule exists (manual weekly at minimum)
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: scripts/ai_full_cycle_weekly.ps1 or docs instruction exists and is followed

  - id: P9-08
    task: Performance-driven adaptation loop exists
    status: NOT_DONE
    evidence: policy suggestions + drift feed into cycle decisions safely
